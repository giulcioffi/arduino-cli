## Configuration keys

- `board_manager`
  - `additional_urls` - the URLs to any additional Boards Manager package index files needed for your boards platforms.
  - `additional_paths` - the file paths to any additional Boards Manager package index files needed for your boards platforms.
- `daemon` - options related to running Arduino CLI as a [gRPC] server.
  - `port` - TCP port used for gRPC client connections.
- `directories` - directories used by Arduino CLI.
  - `data` - directory used to store Boards/Library Manager index files and Boards Manager platform installations.
  - `downloads` - directory used to stage downloaded archives during Boards/Library Manager installations.
  - `user` - the equivalent of the Arduino IDE's ["sketchbook" directory][sketchbook directory]. Library Manager
    installations are made to the `libraries` subdirectory of the user directory.
- `logging` - configuration options for Arduino CLI's logs.
  - `file` - path to the file where logs will be written.
  - `format` - output format for the logs. Allowed values are `text` or `json`.
  - `level` - messages with this level and above will be logged. Valid levels are: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`,
    `error`, `fatal`, `panic`.
- `telemetry` - settings related to the collection of data used for continued improvement of Arduino CLI.
  - `addr` - TCP port used for telemetry communication.
  - `enabled` - controls the use of telemetry.

## Configuration methods

Arduino CLI may be configured in three ways:

1. Command line flags
1. Environment variables
1. Configuration file

If a configuration option is configured by multiple methods, the value set by the method highest on the above list
overwrites the ones below it.

If a configuration option is not set, Arduino CLI uses a default value.

[`arduino-cli config dump`][arduino-cli config dump] displays the current configuration values.

### Command line flags

Arduino CLI's command line flags are documented in the command line help and the [Arduino CLI command reference].

#### Example

Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the [`--additional-urls`][arduino-cli global flags] command line flag:

```shell
$ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json
```

### Environment variables

All configuration options can be set via environment variables. The variable names start with `ARDUINO`, followed by the
configuration key names, with each component separated by `_`. For example, the `ARDUINO_DIRECTORIES_USER` environment
variable sets the `directories.user` configuration option.

On Linux or macOS, you can use the [`export` command][export command] to set environment variables. On Windows cmd, you
can use the [`set` command][set command].

#### Example

Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the `ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS` environment variable:

```sh
$ export ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS=https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json
```

Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the `ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_PATHS` environment variable:

```sh
$ export ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_PATHS=packages/package_staging_index.json
```

### Configuration file

[`arduino-cli config init`][arduino-cli config init] creates or updates a configuration file with the current
configuration settings.

This allows saving the options set by command line flags or environment variables. For example:

```sh
arduino-cli config init --additional-urls https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json
```

#### File name

The configuration file must be named `arduino-cli`, with the appropriate file extension for the file's format.

#### Supported formats

`arduino-cli config init` creates a YAML file, however a variety of common formats are supported:

- [JSON]
- [TOML]
- [YAML]
- [Java properties file]
- [HCL]
- envfile
- [INI]

#### Locations

Configuration files in the following locations are recognized by Arduino CLI:

1. Location specified by the [`--config-file`][arduino cli command reference] command line flag
1. Current working directory
1. Any parent directory of the current working directory (more immediate parents having higher precedence)
1. Arduino CLI data directory (as configured by `directories.data`)

If multiple configuration files are present, the one highest on the above list is used. Configuration files are not
combined.

The location of the active configuration file can be determined by running the command:

```sh
arduino-cli config dump --verbose
```

#### Example

Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using a YAML format configuration file:

```yaml
board_manager:
  additional_urls:
    - https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json
```

Doing the same using a TOML format file:

```toml
[board_manager]
additional_urls = [ "https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json" ]
```
